Calculator for Polystyrene Amount and Price

This module contains a class for calculating the amount of polystyrene required and its price
based on given data, along with supporting utility methods for calculations.

The main class, `AmountPolystyreneAndPrice`, provides methods to calculate the number of polystyrene
packages needed and the total price based on parameters such as wall surface area, price per square
meter, and the amount of polystyrene in one package.

Additionally, this module includes utility methods for rounding numbers and calculating package
counts.
